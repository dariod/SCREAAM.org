            <p>We “San Francisco’s Concerned Residents Experiencing Annoying Aircraft Maneuvers” are an organized group that aims to eliminate or minimize unacceptable noise levels caused by aircraft from the San Francisco Airport (SFO) and the Oakland Airport (OAK) flying over San Francisco.</p>
            <h2>Get involved, help us</h2>
            <p>(1)    Keep an eye on the www.screaam.org  website/blog for news and to see if any actions or help is needed.  Alternatively, if you are really sick of the jet noise and want to help us more and get SUPER involved, then send us a message that says “I want to get SUPER INVOLVED!” and we will contact you directly.</p>
            <p>(2)    Go ahead and FOLLOW the SCREAAM blog at the bottom of the page so you get instant update sent to your email with what is going on.  The same content posted on the site will be sent to you via email automatically upon posting.</p>
            <p>(3)    Go to our own SCREAAM meetings when they happen…. the dates will be posted on this site.   Also, consider going to the broader SFO Roundtable Meetings when they happen.  Check  http://sforoundtable.org/</p>
            <p>(4)    Find a jet noise website you like… (like http://stop.jetnoise.net) and start complaining… or complain directly to these email addresses:  sfo.noise@flysfo.com and 9-AWA-NoiseOmbudsman@faa.gov</p>
            <p>(5)    Ask neighbors that are affected by jet noise to get involved too, by doing the above items too…</p>
